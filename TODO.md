* Turn `dictionary` constructor parameter into a generic `vm` parameter.  Put data stack and return stack at the end of the `vm` buffer.  Put TIB at the start of the buffer (before the dictionary, just like MFORTH).  Allow stack sizes and TIB size to be configured in the constructor.  TIB can be zero if you do not need the text interpreter.
* "Fix" stack usage so that we don't have to waste the last (31st, currently) cell on a TOS value that will never be stored there.  Should probably put the stacks at the beginning of the buffer so that we don't have the issue with sometimes reading TOS from beyond the data stack when the stack is in fact empty.  So organization is: data stack, return stack, TIB, dictionary.
  * May not be able/want to do this given that we want to be able to `PAUSE` and spill TOS back onto the stack...
* Put the global and user vars in the `vm` buffer as well.  Among other things, this allows us to snapshot the system by making a copy of `vm`.
* Reorganize/Clean up source files.  Maybe auto-generate opcodes so that we can avoid some of the duplication, for example.
* Implement pictured numeric output (putting `HLD` in the `vm` buffer).
* Implement compilation (`:`, `COMPILE,`, `;`, etc.).
  * The compiler needs to figure out what kind of word is being compiled and put that opcode into the definition.  This trades compiler expense -- need to interrogate the target word -- for runtime efficiency -- a single jump table for everything.  `COMPILE,` has to convert XTs into a separate 8-bit opcode and 16-bit, dictionary-relative offset (which is already what the XT is, but without the high bit set).  Note that `COMPILE,` will need to use `>BODY` to skip over the LFA, flags, and NFA.
    * Should probably just make DOCOLON8 and DOCOLON16 and then align PFAs to 16-bits so that DOCOLON8 can span a full -512 bytes.
* Move some of the non-critical C++ primitives over to Forth (whatever is uses the least flash).
  * Program space definitions should have a special DOCOLON opcode that can be used to invoke them.  We are currently duplicating the logic to store and set the IP in each of those definitions.  Instead, each of these Forth-based primitive words should just set IP to the word's PFA and then jump to `DOCOLONROM`.
  * And then we should put them all together in a block so that DOCOLONROM can expect the IP to be relative to that block.
  * Might be able to avoid needing tokens for these if we modify XTs to specify if the XT is ROM- or RAM-based.  This would allow us to pack a large number of primitives into ROM without having to assign tokens to all of them.  Tokens would only be needed for high-performance, internal primitives.
    * This is not worth doing because then every reference to those primitives would require three bytes (`DOCOLONROM` token and the XT) instead of just one byte.  We don't actually care about lots of definitions, we just don't want to have it be a pain to define these things.  Using primitives is fine though, we'll just set the Word Pointer to the ROM IP and then `goto` a common block of code that does the return stack pushing and stuff (*i.e.,* `DOPCOLONROM`, although in this case there is no `DOCOLONROM`).
* Modify `test/arf` to optionally take a list of files on the command line and then interpret each file in order (by just feeding the data through `KEY` for now).  This will allow us to start running the anstests.
* Consider adding [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch)-based unit tests in order to augment the anstests-based tests.  Maybe even run the test suite using Catch?
* Forth200x updates (mostly just `TIB` and `#TIB`?, although numeric prefixes look very useful).
* Add `PAUSE`, which spills the registers to global variables in `vm` and then returns from `go()` similar to what we did in Ficl.
* Add dumb exceptions that just restart the VM?
* Since we have more free opcodes now we can probably code in some of the most frequently used FFI functions (`pinWrite` and stuff) as tokens, perhaps through compiler directives.
  * I wonder if we can find a way to predefine a set of trampolines in Flash instead of in RAM?  *i.e.,* we reserve the last 32 opcodes for precompiled trampolines and then provide a simplified way to build up that flash array.  This table-based method would actually work since it would just be a list of other addresses (which conveniently we already have thanks to the `FFIDEF_*` vars that are being used for the linked list).  This would give users a way to modify their ARF compile to predefine externals in a way that consumes no RAM.  You still need to define the FFIs, but you don't need to reference them at runtime.
  * This feels like a good balance between ROM and RAM: you can access any FFI at runtime if you are willing to consume memory on that (which is probably fine during development) and then you switch to a ROM-based FFI primitive once you know you'll be using an FFI a lot.  This breaks your flash, of course, but your source is unchanged (and we could make the `EXTERNAL:` word just do nothing in the case where you are trying to reference a ROM-based FFI primitive).
  * This makes the ATtiny85 possible again, because we'll just define the primitives that we care about as ROM primitives.
