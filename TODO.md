* Add Catch-based unit tests that use the ANS verification stuff.
* Fix up all of the types; sometimes we use uint8_t, sometimes we use arfInteger, etc.
* Turn `dictionary` constructor parameter into a generic `vm` parameter.  Put data stack and return stack at the end of the `vm` buffer.  Put TIB at the start of the buffer (before the dictionary, just like MFORTH).  Allow stack sizes and TIB size to be configured in the constructor.  TIB can be zero if you do not need the text interpreter.
* "Fix" stack usage so that we don't have to waste the last (31st, currently) cell on a TOS value that will never be stored there.  Should probably put the stacks at the beginning of the buffer so that we don't have the issue with sometimes reading TOS from beyond the data stack when the stack is in fact empty.  So organization is: data stack, return stack, TIB, hidden defs, dictionary.
* Implement compilation (`:`, `COMPILE,`, `;`, etc.).
  * The compiler needs to figure out what kind of word is being compiled and put that opcode into the definition.  This trades compiler expense -- need to interrogate the target word -- for runtime efficiency -- a single jump table for everything.  `COMPILE,` has to convert XTs into a separate 8-bit opcode and 16-bit, dictionary-relative offset (which is already what the XT is, but without the high bit set).
    * This change also eliminates the need to differentiate between opcodes and relative offsets, because everything is just an opcode (and then the `DO*` opcodes are followed by the offset).  The only downside is that every call to another word now takes one extra byte of RAM.  The major upside is that now we can create up to 256 opcodes instead of just 128 opcodes; that should enable us to put more stuff into ROM, which might have been necessary anyway...
      * Should probably just make DOCOLON8 and DOCOLON16 and then align PFAs to 16-bits so that DOCOLON8 can span a full -512 bytes.
* Reorganize/Clean up source files.  Maybe auto-generate opcodes so that we can avoid some of the duplication, for example.
* Since we have more free opcodes now we can probably code in some of the most frequently used FFI functions (`pinWrite` and stuff) as tokens, perhaps through compiler directives.
  * I wonder if we can find a way to predefine a set of trampolines in Flash instead of in RAM?  *i.e.,* we reserve the last 32 opcodes for precompiled trampolines and then provide a simplified way to build up that flash array.  This table-based method would actually work since it would just be a list of other addresses (which conveniently we already have thanks to the `FFIDEF_*` vars that are being used for the linked list).  This would give users a way to modify their ARF compile to predefine externals in a way that consumes no RAM.  You still need to define the FFIs, but you don't need to reference them at runtime.
  * This feels like a good balance between ROM and RAM: you can access any FFI at runtime if you are willing to consume memory on that (which is probably fine during development) and then you switch to a ROM-based FFI primitive once you know you'll be using an FFI a lot.  This breaks your flash, of course, but your source is unchanged (and we could make the `EXTERNAL:` word just do nothing in the case where you are trying to reference a ROM-based FFI primitive).
  * This makes the ATtiny85 possible again, because we'll just define the primitives that we care about as ROM primitives.
